Bubble Sort – Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
Time Complexity: O(n²)

Insertion Sort – Builds the sorted list one item at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
Time Complexity: O(n²)

Selection Sort – Repeatedly selects the minimum element and places it at the beginning.
Time Complexity: O(n²)

Merge Sort – A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array, sorts recursively, and merges back.
Time Complexity: O(n log n)

Quick Sort – A divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array around a pivot and sorts subarrays.
Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average, O(n²) in worst case.
